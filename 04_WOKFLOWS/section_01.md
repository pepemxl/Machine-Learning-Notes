# Machine Learning Systems (MLS)
 
In order to create a functioning AI product, we need to put together
a bunch of elements:
- Production Cluster
- Data Collection
- Data Storage
- Generation of Features Jobs
- Training Compute Cluster
- CI/CD Pipelines
- Monitoring
- Experiment Loggers

we call all these ingredients Machine Learning Systems.

## Dataflow

Dataflow is a broad concept, which has various meanings depending on the application and context. In the context of software architecture, data flow relates to stream processing or reactive programming. 

Usually they show the transfer of information from one part of the system to another. Flows link processes, warehouses and terminators. Usual systems for dataflows:
- Airflow
- Dagster
- Dataswarm
- Databricks
- etc...


In this sense many solutions are available, however depends on our data and goals to achieve, which one will be better. In the same sense that a devOps depends takes architecture decisions based on properties desired for the system to guarantee requirements, it will need special patterns in its architecture.
