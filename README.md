## General Machine Learning Projects

Machine Learning projects needs in general the next steps:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Building Datasets
4. Model Training Online/Offline
5. Model Deployment
6. Prediction
7. Monitoring Models
8. Maintenance, Diagnosis, and Retraining

In order to achieve all these steps we need enough tools in our stack, we will incorporate 
enough tools to achieve.

In many large business or startups we deploy machine learning projects going through the next stages:

1. Machine learning frameworks
    - Open AI
    - Tensorflow
    - Pytorch
    - SageMaker
    - GridAI
2. Distributed compute
    - Dask
    - Spark
    - Databricks
3. Model evaluation and experiment tracking
    - MLFlow
    - neptune.ai
    - Comet
4. Model deployment
    - OctoML
    - BentoML
5. Model monitoring and management
    - Fidler
    - Cortex
6. End-to-end platform solutions
    - nvidia
    - databricks
    - SageMaker


### Requirements
