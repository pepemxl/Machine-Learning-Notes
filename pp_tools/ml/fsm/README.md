# State Machine

A state machine is independent of programming language, it is a behavioral model that defines how an object behaves in response to events. A pattern used a lot in functional programming.


## State machine in Python

 In Python, a state machine is typically implemented as a finite state machine (FSM). An FSM is a mathematical model of computation that can be used to design digital logic circuits and computer programs.  It consists of a set of states, transitions between those states, and actions that are performed when a transition occurs.

An FSM can be represented as a directed graph, with the states represented as nodes and the transitions represented as edges. The edges are labeled with the events that trigger the transition, and the actions are associated with the edges.
