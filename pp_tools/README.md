# Tools for ML partial workflows in nodes

I am designing this tool specifically to provide scalable, reliable, reproducible and automated tools to address the following six-step workflow:

1. Manage datasets locally
    - restricted to relative small datasets
2. Compute quality of datasets/features/clusters for ML projects:
    - Considering labeling for supervised
    - Common metrics for clusters
    - Test new features
    - Creation of reports
3. Train models
4. Evaluate models
5. Make predictions
6. Monitor predictions
