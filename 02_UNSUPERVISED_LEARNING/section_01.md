# Inttroduction

While **supervised learning** requires users to help the machine to learn from labeling data, **unsupervised learning** doesn't use the same labeled training sets neither data. Instead, the machine looks for less obvious patterns in the data. This machine learning type is very helpful when you need to identify patterns and use data to make decisions. Common algorithms used in unsupervised learning include **Hidden Markov models**, **k-means**, **hierarchical clustering**, and **Gaussian mixture models**.

Using the example from supervised learning, let's say you didn't know which customers did or didn't default on loans. Instead, you'd provide the machine with borrower information and it would look for patterns between borrowers before grouping them into several clusters.

This type of machine learning is widely used to create predictive models. Common applications also include clustering, which creates a model that groups objects together based on specific properties, and association, which identifies the rules existing between the clusters. A few example use cases include:

Creating customer groups based on purchase behavior

Grouping inventory according to sales and/or manufacturing metrics

Pinpointing associations in customer data (for example, customers who buy a specific style of handbag might be interested in a specific style of shoe)

These are classic example that you will find searching for examples.
