# Introduction


**Supervised learning** is maybe the most utilized machine learning method in the last years. Common algorithms used during supervised learning includes **neural networks**, **decision trees**, **linear regression**, and **support vector machines**.

This machine learning type got its name because the machine is “supervised” while it's learning, which means that you’re feeding the algorithm information to help it learn. The outcome you provide the machine is labeled data, and the rest of the information you give is used as input features.

Supervised learning is effective for a variety of business purposes, including sales forecasting, inventory optimization, and fraud detection. Some classic examples of use cases include:

- Predicting real estate prices
- Classifying whether bank transactions are fraudulent or not
- Finding disease risk factors
- Determining whether loan applicants are low-risk or high-risk
- Predicting the failure of industrial equipment's mechanical parts
