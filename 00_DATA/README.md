# The Six  Phases/Steps of data Analysis

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act


## Ask Phase

In the ask phase, you'll work to understand the challenge to be solved or the question to be answered. It will likely be assigned to you by stakeholders. As this is the ask phase, you'll ask many questions to help you along the way. 

First up, the analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. 

## Prepare

In the prepare phase, you'll find and collect the data you'll need to answer your questions. You'll identify data sources, gather data, and verify that it is accurate and useful for answering your questions.

It all started with solid preparation. The group should built a timeline and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. During this step the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step. 

These were the things they did to prepare, analyst shoud to establish rules for who would have access to the data collected.

## Process
The process phase is when you will clean and organize your data. Tasks you perform here include removing any inconsistencies; filling in missing values; and, in many cases, changing the data to a format that's easier to work with. Essentially, youâ€™re ensuring the data is ready before you begin analysis.

Surveys can be a great source of data. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure people understood how their data would be 
- collected, 
- stored, 
- managed, and 
- protected. 

Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts. In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, these were the steps they took:
- They restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts. 
- They cleaned the data to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data was aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses. 
- They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security. 

## Analyze

The analyze phase is when you do the necessary data analysis to uncover answers and solutions. Depending on the situation and the data, this could involve tasks such as calculating averages or counting items in categories so you can examine trends and patterns.

For analysts it is important to document exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. To do otherwise would diminish trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from people in the future. 

## Share

The share phase, when you present your findings to decision-makers through a report, presentation, or data visualizations. As part of the share phase, you decide which medium you want to use to share your findings and select the data to include. Tools for presenting data visually include charts made in Google Sheets, Tableau, and R.

Analyst have to be aware the data should be shared carefully and protected.

## Act

The act phase, in which you and others in the company put the data insights into action. This could mean implementing a new business strategy, making changes to a website, or any other action that solves the initial problem. 

The last stage of the process for the team of analysts is to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to implement changes and take actions based on the findings.
