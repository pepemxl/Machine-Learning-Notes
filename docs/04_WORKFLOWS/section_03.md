## Model Centric Bias and GIGO principle

It is very common to tend to pay too much attention to ML models while neglecting other important parts in the creation of Machine Learning Systems. It is due to a phenomenon often called **model centric bias**.

The formal approach to perform data analysis from the manual is a serie of steps:
 - collect data with an ETL or ELT process,  
 - perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in this collections, then 
 - create hypothesis using our EDA, then finally
 - try models on them to confirm or neglect hypothesis.


Tha actual approach in many AI projects is a little more complex,
usually are based on data preexistent that was created with application
purposes,
is define goals, then a review of existing models is performed with the solenly objective can help you to achieve that goal
