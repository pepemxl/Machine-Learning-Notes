# J.A.R.V.I.S

Jarvis is an acronym for Just a Rather Very Intelligent System


There are many functions that a decent AI system can perform.

Lets start to create a small agent capable of:

- answer questions that an expert of security could provide.
- security analysis of python code, we have a few databases to start with.
- provide guidelines to address security vulnerabilities, this will be tricky for vulnerabilities that are not library upgrades.
- check our system metrics to look for anomalies in the latest 24h using some anomaly detection algorithms.
- create reports of security.
