You need to go to [Meta website](https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads/) to request access to Llama, then a request will be generated:

`Request ID: 2133934780338394`

Then you will receive an email with instructions to clone repository and use an script to download weights, this script will require you an http url provided in the email. Take in cosideration that to download all this weight could be around 300GB.

Regarless models seems to be public, dataset still private.

Llama 2 is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks tested.

Only to get an idea trainning those models cost
