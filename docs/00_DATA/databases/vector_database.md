# Vector Database


A **vector database* is a type of database designed specifically to store and manage vector data. In computing, a vector typically refers to an ordered collection of elements, each identified by an index. However, in the context of databases, a vector often refers to a mathematical construct used to represent data points in multi-dimensional space.

In a vector database, data is stored and queried based on its vector representation, allowing for efficient retrieval and analysis of spatial data, such as geographic information, image data, or any other data that can be represented as vectors.

These databases often employ specialized indexing and query optimization techniques to handle the high-dimensional nature of vector data efficiently. They are commonly used in applications such as geographical information systems (GIS), machine learning, computer vision, and recommendation systems.
