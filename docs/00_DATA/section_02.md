# Databases

Database models have gone through incredible growth amidst recent technological developments. Gone are the days when businesses and organizations relied solely on relational databases to store and manage their data.

Now we have many uses for database giving origin to very special cases together with the usual:


Databases can be categorized into several types based on various criteria such as data model, storage structure, accessibility, and intended use. Here are some common types of databases:

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Relational databases organize data into tables with rows and columns. Examples include:

        - MySQL,
        - PostgreSQL,
        - SQL Server
        - DB2
        - Oracle,
        - SQL Server,
        - SQLite.
    They use Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and managing data.

2. **NoSQL Databases**: NoSQL databases encompass a wide range of non-relational database technologies. They are designed to handle various types of unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data. Examples include 

        - MongoDB,
        - Cassandra,
        - Redis,
        - Couchbase.
    NoSQL databases offer flexibility, scalability, and better performance for certain use cases compared to traditional relational databases.

3. **Graph Databases**: Graph databases are optimized for storing and querying graph data structures. They represent data as nodes, edges, and properties, which are interconnected. Examples include:

        - Neo4j,
        - Amazon Neptune,
        - JanusGraph.
   Graph databases are suitable for applications requiring complex relationship analysis, such as social networks and recommendation systems.

4. **Columnar Databases**: Columnar databases store data in columns rather than rows, which can provide faster query performance for analytics and reporting. Examples include:

        - Apache Cassandra,
        - ClickHouse,
        - Google BigQuery.
   They are well-suited for **OLAP** (Online Analytical Processing) workloads where aggregations and analytics on large datasets are common.

5. **Document Databases**: Document databases store data in a semi-structured format like JSON or BSON documents. Each document can have its own structure, making them flexible for storing heterogeneous data. Examples include: 
        
        - MongoDB,
        - Couchbase,
        - Firebase Firestore.
   Document databases are commonly used in content management systems, real-time analytics, and applications with frequently changing schemas.

6. **Spatial Databases**: Spatial databases are designed to store and query spatial data, such as geographic information system (**GIS**) data and geometry data. They support spatial data types and operations for analyzing and visualizing spatial relationships. Examples include:

        - PostGIS (extension of PostgreSQL),
        - MongoDB (with geospatial indexing),
        - Oracle Spatial, 

7. **Time-Series Databases**: Time-series databases specialize in handling time-series data, which is data points indexed or ordered by time. They are optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data efficiently. Examples include:

        - InfluxDB,
        - Prometheus,
        - TimescaleDB.
        - OpenSTDB
        - Goku
   Time-series databases are used in applications such as IoT (Internet of Things), monitoring, and financial trading systems.


Today as the amount and complexity of data are growing, we need a more flexible and dynamic way to represent and analyze relationships between data points. Enter knowledge graphsâ€“a modern data management topology quickly gaining popularity among data-driven businesses.
